      <p>1.2 On-Device Processing Only</p>
      <p>
        All photo and video analysis occurs entirely on your device using
        Apple's PhotoKit framework. This includes:

          Location classification (using EXIF metadata embedded in your photos)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The analysis results never leave your device and are stored only in your
        device's local cache.
      </p>

      <p>1.3 Purchase Information</p>
