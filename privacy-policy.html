        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 3, 2025
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how

      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 On-Device Processing Only</h3>
      <p>
        All photo and video analysis occurs entirely on your device using
        Apple's PhotoKit framework. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duplicate photo detection</li>
        <li>Blur detection</li>
        <li>Screenshot identification</li>
        <li>Large file analysis</li>
        <li>
          Location classification (using EXIF metadata embedded in your photos)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The analysis results never leave your device and are stored only in your
        device's local cache.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Purchase Information</h3>
      <p>
        When you subscribe to Ezy Photo Clean Premium, your purchase is

        Apple handles all payment processing, and we never have access to your
        credit card information, billing address, or other payment details.
        Please review
